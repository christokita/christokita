## Hi there 🤙

I am a complex systems scientist and computational {ecologist, social scientist} turned data + AI scientist for good.

- 🧑‍💻 **Current role**: Senior Appied AI/ML Scientist at Sprout Social
- 💼 **Past workplaces**: Stripe, Phylum, Princeton University, IDA Science & Technology Policy Institute
- 💭 **Thinks about**: social networks, complex systems, and collective behavior in societies—from ant and bee colonies to cities and social media
- 🎓 **Alma maters**: Princeton (PhD), Yale (BS), LAUSD (K-12)
- 🏄‍♂️ **Non-technical interests**: surfing, weight lifting, LA sports (go Dodgers + Lakers!), housing policy, CA politics


Outside of my day job, here are current side projects you might find me working on
1. 🕸️ **Agent-based model of social networks**: simulations examining how population density affects social network structure and information flow in social systems
2. 🗳️ **Detecting realignments in US presidential elections, 1960-2024**: using unsupervised learning on county-level election data to find different eras of modern American politics
